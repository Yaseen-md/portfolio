Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/[yourname]/your-portfolio.git
cd your-portfolio

2. Update Placeholders





Replace placeholders in index.html:





[Your Name]: Your full name



[yourname@email.com]: Your email



[linkedin.com/in/yourname]: Your LinkedIn URL



[github.com/yourname]: Your GitHub URL



[yourportfolio.com]: Your portfolio domain (if applicable)



Profile picture and project screenshot URLs (replace https://via.placeholder.com links)



Add resume.pdf to the project root for the "Download Resume" link.

3. Set Up Firebase





Create a Firebase project at console.firebase.google.com.



Copy your Firebase config object from Project Settings and replace the placeholder in index.html:

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};



Set up a Firebase Cloud Function for the contact form:





Install Firebase CLI:

npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login



Initialize Functions:

firebase init functions



In functions/index.js, add:

const functions = require('firebase-functions');
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: { user: '[your-email@gmail.com]', pass: '[your-app-password]' }
});
exports.sendMessage = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  const { name, email, message } = data;
  await transporter.sendMail({
    from: '[your-email@gmail.com]',
    to: '[yourname@email.com]',
    subject: `New Message from ${name}`,
    text: `Name: ${name}\nEmail: ${email}\nMessage: ${message}`
  });
  return { status: 'Message sent' };
});



Install dependencies:

cd functions
npm install nodemailer



Deploy:

firebase deploy --only functions

4. Run Locally





Use a local server to test:

npm install -g http-server
http-server .



Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.



Alternatively, use Python:

python -m http.server 8000



Test the contact form and animations.

5. Deploy to Vercel





Push to GitHub:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial portfolio commit"
git push origin main



Log in to vercel.com.



Create a new project and import your GitHub repository.



Configure:





Framework Preset: Other
